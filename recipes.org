2. Add bread slices and allow to sit a few minutes to soak up the liquids, then
   stir until bread is incorporated with liquids.
3. Add ground beef and sausage to bowl.

** Sweet and Sour Chicken
[[http://www.melskitchencafe.com/sweet-and-sour-chicken-updated/][Original recipe]]
*** Ingredients
- Chicken
  - 3-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds)
  - Salt and pepper
  - 1 cup cornstarch
  - 2 large eggs, beaten
  - 1/4 cup canola, vegetable or coconut oil
- Sauce
  - 1/2 to 3/4 cup granulated sugar (depending on how sweet you want the sauce)
  - 4 tablespoons ketchup
  - 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon garlic salt
*** Recipe
1. Preheat the oven to 165 deg C.
2. Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Season with salt and
   pepper. Place the cornstarch in a gallon-sized ziploc bag. Put the chicken
   into the bag with the cornstarch and seal, tossing to coat the chicken.
3. Whisk the eggs together in a shallow pie plate. Heat the oil in a large
   skillet over medium heat until very hot and rippling. Dip the
   cornstarch-coated chicken pieces in the egg and place them carefully in a
   single layer in the hot skillet.
4. Cook for 20-30 seconds on each side until the crust is golden but the chicken
   is not all the way cooked through (this is where it's really important to
   have a hot skillet/oil). Place the chicken pieces in a single layer in a
   9X13-inch baking dish and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.
5. Mix the sauce ingredients together in a medium bowl and pour over the
   chicken. Bake for one hour, turning the chicken once or twice while cooking
   to coat evenly with sauce. Serve over hot, steamed rice.

** Pork Belly Slides
From: http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/10/sous-vide-pork-belly-bun-pork-braise-mayonnaise-quick-pickled-cucumbers-recipe.html
*** Ingredients
- 1 dl cup soy sauce
- 1 dl mirin
- 1 dl granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 whole scallions, roughly chopped
- 3 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 1 (2-inch) chunk ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 kg pork belly, in as large pieces as possible (preferably 1 or 2 whole
  slabs)
- 1.5 dl mayonnaise, preferably homemade
- 24 fresh or frozen Chinese-style steamed buns
- 1 head bibb lettuce, washed, dried, and torn into medium-sized pieces
- 1 recipe Quick-Pickled Cucumbers with Rice Vinegar
*** Recipe
1. Preheat a sous-vide style water bath to 77 deg C. Combine soy sauce, mirin,
   sugar, fish sauce, scallions, garlic, and ginger in the bowl of a food
   processor. Process until vegetables are roughly pureed. Transfer pork belly
   and marinade to a food-saver style vacuum bag and seal. Alternatively,
   transfer to a heavy duty gallon-sized freezer bag and seal by slowly
   submerging into a pot full of water, sealing the top just before it goes
   underwater to remove all air. Transfer to sous vide cooker and cook until
   completely tender, about 10 hours. Remove bag from cooker and chill
   thoroughly. Pork belly can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks
   after cooking if the bag remains sealed.
2. When ready to serve, open sous vide bag and remove pork belly. Discard solid
   chunks of fat. Warm congealed liquids in a small saucepan, then strain
   through a fine mesh strainer. Return to saucepan and simmer until reduced to
   2 tablespoons, making sure that the syrup doesn't reduce too far and burn,
   about 15 minutes.
3. Transfer reduced cooking liquid to a medium bowl. Add mayonnaise and whisk to
   combine.
4. Preheat broiler to high. Cut pork belly into 1 1/2-inch wide strips, then
   slice into 1/2- to 1/3-inch slices. Transfer to a foil lined broiler
   pan. Broil pork belly until crisp and charred on one side, about 3 minutes.
5. To Serve: Steam buns in a bamboo steamer or in the microwave on a large plate
   under a damp towel. Spread mayonnaise onto each bun, then stuff with lettuce
   leaf, slices of pork belly, and pickles. Serve immediately.

** Rebecka's Chocolate Chip Cookies
*** Ingredients
- 7.7 dl flour
- 1.2 dl granulated sugar (strösocker)
- 3.5 dl light brown sugar (brun farin)
- 2 eggs
- 250 g butter
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 15 tsp baking powder (bakpulver)
- 1 tsp baking soda (bikarbonat)
- 1  tsp salt (I use 3-4 pinches of sea salt)
- 0.6 dl maple syrup
- 2 tsp vanilla sugar (or vanilla extract)
- 4.8 dl chocolate chip cookies (I divide it evenly with light, dark and white chocolate chips)
*** Recipe
Picture of ingredients:

[[./images/rcc01.jpg]]

1. Start with melting the butter (but make sure it does not boil, you do not
   want it to melt the sugar) mix it with both sugars. Add eggs one at a time
   and mix, preferably have them at room temperature beforehand. Add maple syrup
   and mix. (If you have vanilla extract add it here.)

   [[./images/rcc02.jpg]]

   [[./images/rcc03.jpg]]
2. In a separate bowl mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda and
   salt. (If you use vanilla sugar add it here.)
3. Slowly mix the dry ingredients in with the wet a little bit at a time. (I use
   an electric whisk with dough hooks for this.) After fully mixed add in the
   chocolate chips and mix again.

   [[./images/rcc04.jpg]]

   [[./images/rcc05.jpg]]

   [[./images/rcc06.jpg]]
4. Once dough is done put it in a zip lock bag and let rest in the fridge for at
   least an hour, but preferably longer. Have any dough you’re not cooking in
   the fridge afterwards.

   [[./images/rcc07.jpg]]

   [[./images/rcc08.jpg]]
5. When ready to cook put cookies in balls of 1,5 -2 table spoons on baking
   paper on a tray. Make sure to have some of the chocolate chips upwards, or
   add some new ones to make cookies even prettier. Leave a few cm in between
   each ball to make sure they do not melt together. Try and make the balls a
   little bit higher than wide. Cook at 175 C in the middle of the oven between
   10-14 minutes depending on the size of the cookies. When they start to get a
   slight golden color on top they are ready.

   [[./images/rcc09.jpg]]
6. Let cool on the tray. Should have a soft consistency, and tastes better if
   you let it rest for an hour or two after it’s done.

Recipe from
http://www.italyum.com/pizza-recipes/199-pizza-using-fresh-yeast.html
*** Ingredients
- 500 g Italian "00" or "0" type flour for pizza (alternatively use plain flour)
- 15 g Fresh yeast (fresh compressed yeast)
- 10 g Fine sea salt bp 2%
- 5 g Malt extract bp 1% - optional
- 20 g  Extra virgin olive oil bp 4%
- 300 g Tepid water bp 60%
*** Recipe
1. Put the flour into a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Using your hands or a
   wooden spoon, stir to evenly distribute the salt within the flour.
2. Crumble the fresh yeast with your hand and add it into the bowl.
3. Rub the fresh yeast through the flour, to further break it down (1 or 2
   minutes will be sufficient).
4. Add the malt extract to the water and stir. It should dissolve in few
   seconds.
5. Add the water and malt mix into the bowl.
6. Add the olive oil into the bowl.
7. Using your hand, start mixing in circular motion.
8. Keep mixing until all the ingredients come together.
9. After a couple of minutes mixing, you should have a dough at its early stage
   of development. Now, we knead the dough so that it can develop the gluten and
   become firmer.

   The pizza dough in this recipe has 60% hydration. This quantity of water
   should give you a firm dough, however not all the pizza flours have the same
   quantity of proteins, so if you end up using a pizza flour at its lowest
   protein content, during a very humid day, you may have to knead a soft dough
   instead of a firm dough. If that is the case, knead the dough using the
   stretch and fold method ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlaL98Wg3eU&feature=youtu.be][watch this short video]]).

   If your dough is firm, then knead the dough using the push, roll and turn
   method ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSGOcSl9vtU&feature=youtu.be][watch this short video]]).
10. When the dough has been kneaded for at least 10 minutes, you should have a
    smooth, silky and elastic dough. Now, we need to shape the dough into a
    ball. To do so, lift and fold the outer edges of the dough towards the
    centre, while rotating the dough at the same time and tucking the edges into
    the centre of the ball.  Anything between six and eight folds should be
    enough.
11. When finished, turn the dough over and with both hands rotate the dough
    while applying gentle pressure to the bottom (as if tucking the dough
    underneath).
12. Grease the inside of a large bowl with a thin coat of olive oil.
13. Roll the ball inside the bowl, lightly coating the surface of the ball with oil.
14. Cover the bowl and leave the dough to rise for a couple of hours. This is
    called bulk fermentation.  Before we do anything with our dough, we need to
    wait until it has raised properly. Let raise for 2 hours.
15. Next, divide the dough in five segments of equal weight (150-160 g each).
16. Make a ball out of each segment. To do so, roughly pre-shape the segment
    into a ball, then cup your hands over the ball. Press down and move your
    hand in a circular motion, while keeping the hand cupped. This action will
    compact the ball into a tight round shape.
17. Spread some flour over the working surface and lay your dough balls onto it.
18. Cover the dough balls with a dry cloth and leave them to rest for 1
    hour. This time is called final fermentation.
19. Once the final fermentation is completed, lightly flour the working surface
    and take the first dough ball. Using a rolling pin, start rolling so that
    you can make a large circle.

    The pizza base should match a 30 cm (12") diameter pizza tray.

    The pizza base should be very thin; I would say 2 or 3 millimetres (1/16" or
    1/8") thick.
20. Preheat the oven to its maximum heat (usually around 240 deg C).
21. Add toppings to pizza.  As the final touch, put a dash of olive oil over the
    toppings and brush the outer crust with olive oil.
22. Cook 7 - 10 minutes.  Let cool before serving.
