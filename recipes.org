** Freshmama Meatballs
[[http://www.freshmama.net/2014/02/fmcc-make-ahead-meals-and-artisan-bread.html#meatballs][Original Recipe]]
*** Ingredients
- 500 g ground beef, pork, or turkey

  like) I often choose a mixture of hot and mild.

- 2 cloves crushed garlic

- 1/3 cup milk
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 slices sandwich bread
- 2 Tablespoons grated parmesan (optional)
*** Recipe
1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together onion, garlic, Italian seasoning,
   milk, eggs, salt and pepper (parmesan, if using)
2. Add bread slices and allow to sit a few minutes to soak up the liquids, then
   stir until bread is incorporated with liquids.
3. Add ground beef and sausage to bowl.
4. Using your hands, mix just until all ingredients are evenly distributed.
5. Form meatballs using your hands - about the size of a golf ball.

** Sweet and Sour Chicken
*** Ingredients
- Chicken
  - 3-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds)
  - Salt and pepper
  - 1 cup cornstarch
  - 2 large eggs, beaten
  - 1/4 cup canola, vegetable or coconut oil
- Sauce
  - 1/2 to 3/4 cup granulated sugar (depending on how sweet you want the sauce)
  - 4 tablespoons ketchup
  - 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon garlic salt
*** Recipe
1. Preheat the oven to 165 deg C.
2. Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Season with salt and
   pepper. Place the cornstarch in a gallon-sized ziploc bag. Put the chicken
   into the bag with the cornstarch and seal, tossing to coat the chicken.
3. Whisk the eggs together in a shallow pie plate. Heat the oil in a large
   skillet over medium heat until very hot and rippling. Dip the
   cornstarch-coated chicken pieces in the egg and place them carefully in a
   single layer in the hot skillet.
4. Cook for 20-30 seconds on each side until the crust is golden but the chicken
   is not all the way cooked through (this is where it's really important to
   have a hot skillet/oil). Place the chicken pieces in a single layer in a
   9X13-inch baking dish and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.
5. Mix the sauce ingredients together in a medium bowl and pour over the
   chicken. Bake for one hour, turning the chicken once or twice while cooking
   to coat evenly with sauce. Serve over hot, steamed rice.
