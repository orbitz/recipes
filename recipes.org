** Sweet and Sour Chicken
[[http://www.melskitchencafe.com/sweet-and-sour-chicken-updated/][Original recipe]]
*** Ingredients
- Chicken
  - 3-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds)
  - Salt and pepper
  - 1 cup cornstarch
  - 2 large eggs, beaten
  - 1/4 cup canola, vegetable or coconut oil
- Sauce
  - 1/2 to 3/4 cup granulated sugar (depending on how sweet you want the sauce)
  - 4 tablespoons ketchup
  - 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon garlic salt
*** Recipe
1. Preheat the oven to 165 deg C.
2. Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Season with salt and
   pepper. Place the cornstarch in a gallon-sized ziploc bag. Put the chicken
   into the bag with the cornstarch and seal, tossing to coat the chicken.
3. Whisk the eggs together in a shallow pie plate. Heat the oil in a large
   skillet over medium heat until very hot and rippling. Dip the
   cornstarch-coated chicken pieces in the egg and place them carefully in a
   single layer in the hot skillet.
4. Cook for 20-30 seconds on each side until the crust is golden but the chicken
   is not all the way cooked through (this is where it's really important to
   have a hot skillet/oil). Place the chicken pieces in a single layer in a
   9X13-inch baking dish and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.
5. Mix the sauce ingredients together in a medium bowl and pour over the
   chicken. Bake for one hour, turning the chicken once or twice while cooking
   to coat evenly with sauce. Serve over hot, steamed rice.

** Pork Belly Slides
From: http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/10/sous-vide-pork-belly-bun-pork-braise-mayonnaise-quick-pickled-cucumbers-recipe.html
*** Ingredients
- 1 dl cup soy sauce
- 1 dl mirin
- 1 dl granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 whole scallions, roughly chopped
- 3 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 1 (2-inch) chunk ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 kg pork belly, in as large pieces as possible (preferably 1 or 2 whole
  slabs)
- 1.5 dl mayonnaise, preferably homemade
- 24 fresh or frozen Chinese-style steamed buns
- 1 head bibb lettuce, washed, dried, and torn into medium-sized pieces
- 1 recipe Quick-Pickled Cucumbers with Rice Vinegar
*** Recipe
1. Preheat a sous-vide style water bath to 77 deg C. Combine soy sauce, mirin,
   sugar, fish sauce, scallions, garlic, and ginger in the bowl of a food
   processor. Process until vegetables are roughly pureed. Transfer pork belly
   and marinade to a food-saver style vacuum bag and seal. Alternatively,
   transfer to a heavy duty gallon-sized freezer bag and seal by slowly
   submerging into a pot full of water, sealing the top just before it goes
   underwater to remove all air. Transfer to sous vide cooker and cook until
   completely tender, about 10 hours. Remove bag from cooker and chill
   thoroughly. Pork belly can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks
   after cooking if the bag remains sealed.
2. When ready to serve, open sous vide bag and remove pork belly. Discard solid
   chunks of fat. Warm congealed liquids in a small saucepan, then strain
   through a fine mesh strainer. Return to saucepan and simmer until reduced to
   2 tablespoons, making sure that the syrup doesn't reduce too far and burn,
   about 15 minutes.
3. Transfer reduced cooking liquid to a medium bowl. Add mayonnaise and whisk to
   combine.
4. Preheat broiler to high. Cut pork belly into 1 1/2-inch wide strips, then
   slice into 1/2- to 1/3-inch slices. Transfer to a foil lined broiler
   pan. Broil pork belly until crisp and charred on one side, about 3 minutes.
5. To Serve: Steam buns in a bamboo steamer or in the microwave on a large plate
   under a damp towel. Spread mayonnaise onto each bun, then stuff with lettuce
   leaf, slices of pork belly, and pickles. Serve immediately.

- 3.5 dl light brown sugar (brun farin)
- 2 eggs
- 250 g butter
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 1.5 tsp baking powder (bakpulver)
- 1 tsp baking soda (bikarbonat)
- 1  tsp salt (I use 3-4 pinches of sea salt)
- 0.6 dl maple syrup
- 2 tsp vanilla sugar (or vanilla extract)
- 4.8 dl chocolate chip cookies (I divide it evenly with light, dark and white chocolate chips)
*** Recipe

1. Start with melting the butter (but make sure it does not boil, you do not
   want it to melt the sugar) mix it with both sugars. Add eggs one at a time
   and mix, preferably have them at room temperature beforehand. Add maple syrup
   and mix. (If you have vanilla extract add it here.)

   [[./images/rcc03.jpg]]
2. In a separate bowl mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda and
   salt. (If you use vanilla sugar add it here.)
3. Slowly mix the dry ingredients in with the wet a little bit at a time. (I use
   an electric whisk with dough hooks for this.) After fully mixed add in the
   chocolate chips and mix again.

4. Once dough is done put it in a zip lock bag and let rest in the fridge for at
   least an hour, but preferably longer. Have any dough you’re not cooking in
   the fridge afterwards.

   [[./images/rcc08.jpg]]
5. When ready to cook put cookies in balls of 1,5 -2 table spoons on baking
   paper on a tray. Make sure to have some of the chocolate chips upwards, or
   add some new ones to make cookies even prettier. Leave a few cm in between
   each ball to make sure they do not melt together. Try and make the balls a
   little bit higher than wide. Cook at 175 C in the middle of the oven between
   10-14 minutes depending on the size of the cookies. When they start to get a
   slight golden color on top they are ready.

   [[./images/rcc09.jpg]]
6. Let cool on the tray. Should have a soft consistency, and tastes better if
   you let it rest for an hour or two after it’s done.

** Cast Iron Pizza
Recipe from
*** Ingredients
- 3.5 dl warm water
- 60 ml olive oil
- 9 dl flour (more gluten the better)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 2 tsp yeast
*** Recipe
When making this dough, you want it wet as opposed to dry.  It should not be
sticking to your hands but given how the dough will be cooked we don't want it
to dry out.

When cooking, the goal is to use the cast iron on the stove to cook the bottom
of the dough for a bit, and then we'll finish the pizza in the oven, and finally
depending on how the bottom looks, we might just let it sit in the cast iron for
a few minutes after taking it out of the oven.  We want the bottom to have some
dark spots on it and be crunchy while not being dry.

At any point in the recipe you might need to use flour to keep the dough from
sticking to whatever surface you're working it on.  Use your best judgement.

**** Dough
1. Combine yeast in a portion of the warm water and let bubble a bit.
2. Combine flour, olive oil, sugar, and salt.
3. Begin mixing with your hand in a circular motion.
4. Combine yeast water into mix while stirring with hand.
5. Add rest of water.
6. Add in a bit more flour if the dough is too wet.
7. After it's starting to be manageable, move to kneed it for at least 10
   minutes on the counter.  The dough should be smooth but elastic.  If you
   press it with your finger it should bounce back.
8. Form the dough into a ball.
9. Put some olive oil into a large bowl.
10. Put the ball of dough into the bowl and move the ball around until it is
    covered in olive oil.
11. Cover and let rise for 1 - 2 hours.
12. Once risen, kneed the dough for a few minutes and then roll into a tube
    shape
13. Divide the tube into four parts.
14. Turn each part into a ball and cover, let rise again for 30 - 40 minutes.
15. At this point you can freeze the balls for up to three months or store in
    the fridge for 24 hours.

**** Pizza
1. Preheat the oven to somewhere between 200 deg C and 240 deg C depending on
   how hot the oven gets.
2. Preheat the cast iron skillet at medium to medium high.  You do not need any
   oil or butter on the pan, the dough will go on it directly.
3. Spread the dough out on your counter to the size of your cast iron, a bit
   bigger, so you can build the edge of the crust.
4. Once the cast iron is hot, place the dough into it.  This will take some
   practice but doesn't need to be perfect.  To some degree you can pick it up
   and move it around in the pan to get it right.
5. Let the dough cook in the cast iron while you add your toppings.  Brush some
   olive oil on the edge of the crust to help it crunch.
6. It's up to your best judgment how long this should cook.  The dough should
   not be fully cooked in the cast iron, we just want to give it a head start so
   it'll be crunchy once we're done.  I go around 5 minutes in the cast iron.
7. Put in oven until the cheese is cooked.  Should bubble and be browning.
8. Remove from oven, you can tilt the pizza out of the pan to see how cooked the
   bottom is, if it's not cooked enough, let it sit in the hot cast iron for a
   bit longer to cook.
9. Once done, remove from cast iron, let rest for five minutes.
10. Slice and enjoy.

* Sichuan
** Sichuan pepper
I prefer to get the whole pepper corns and crush them in a mortar and pestle.  I
crush, filter through a strainer to remove remaining chunks of shell, repeat one
more time to get remaining bits, then throw away the remaining shell.  The end
result should be a soft powder.

I have also found that Sichuan pepper is delicate, if added to a dish while it's
too hot it will lose its mala effect.  Additionally, I have found that adding it
to a complete dish means one gets clumps of the powder in a bite, making the
experience inconsistent.  Therefore, I suggest finding a point in the
preparation of a dish where the heat is coming down but it can still be mixed
in.
** Mapo Tofu
This is a very delicate dish so we want to use the softest tofu you can find.
When the tofu is added into the sauce, don't be afraid when stirring it in.  Be
gentle but despite the tofu being so delicate, it will survive.

Like most Sichuan dishes, this comes together quickly so you are going to want
all of the ingredients ready to go by the time you have started cooking so you
can just dump them in, otherwise you risk burning the ingredients.

*** Ingredients
| *Ingredient*                | *Amount*                             |
|-----------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Tofu (soft, silken)         | 500g                                 |
| Scallions                   | To your heart's content              |
| Cooking oil                 | 4 - 6 tbsp depending on how you feel |
| Ground beef/pork (optional) | 100 g                                |
| Sichuan chile bean paste    | 2.5 tbsp                             |
| Fermented black beans       | 1 tbsp                               |
| Ground chiles               | 2 tsp                                |
| Sichuan pepper              | 2+ tsp                               |
| Chopped garlic              | 1 tbsp                               |
| Chopped ginger              | 1 tbsp                               |

| Ground white pepper         | A pinch                              |
| Potato starch               | 1 tbsp mixed with cold water         |
*** Recipe
1. Before prepping other ingredients, cut the tofu into cubes and place in warm
   water with a tiny bit of salt.  This will sit here until we eventually strain
   it and add it to the dish.  I'm not entirely sure but I believe this process
   gives the tofu a bit of strength.
2. Measure out ingredients, chop scallions (I prefer making them a bit long
   rather than very small), garlic, and ginger.
3. Optional: heat wok with 1 tbsp of oil and cook ground beef/pork, when done,
   remove from wok and set aside.
4. Heat wok with 4 - 5 tbsp of oil, don't be afraid to experiment here, I
   sometimes go as low as 2 tbsp if I don't want it feeling so oily.
5. Add chile bean paste to hot oil and stir in.
6. Add black beans and ground chiles (not Sichuan chile) and mix in.
7. Let cook into you can smell it, but keep moving and don't overheat.
8. Add garlic and ginger, again let cook until it smells amazing.
9. Remove tofu from water and gently add into sauce.
10. Add optional meat.
11. Add stock and white paper.
12. Mix the tofu into the sauce, be gentle.  Use the lack of your spatula.
13. Bring to a boil.
14. Bring heat down, let simmer, let that tofu really suck up the flavors.
15. Add the Sichuan pepper and scallions.
16. Mix in potato starch to thicken it up.  Repeat a few times as necessary to
    get a thick sauce, but be careful as it can get thick out of nowhere.

     potato starch/water mix as necessary, but be conservative because it can
     thicken up out of nowhere.

*** Recipe
1. Cut eggplant into batons and cook.  You have two options: deep frying or
   oven.  I prefer the oven because it makes the eggplant a bit less heavy.  To
   cook the batons in the oven, give them a layer of oil, and place in a
   pre-heated oven at 220 deg C for 15 - 20 minutes.  Keep an eye on them
   because you want them to have some structure to them, if they cook too much
   they'll just shrivel up.
2. Heat 3 tbsp of cooking oil in the wok.
3. Add chile bean paste and mix into oil, be care not to burn.
4. Add garlic and ginger and move around in oil, cook until nice and fragrant.
5. Add the water/stock, sugar, and soy.
6. Bring to a boil.
7. Add eggplant, be gentle with it.
8. Reduce heat.
9. Mix in Sichuan chile pepper.
10. Mix in the potato starch to thicken the gravy, do it slowly so it doesn't
    over-thicken.
11. Mix in the vinegar and scallions.
